# Heart Failure Prediction

**Description**
[*About this dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data)

    Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
    Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

    Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

    People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

**Task**

    Create a model for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure.

**Steps Involved**
    
    1. Reading and understanding the data
    2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    3. Performing Train-Test Split
    4. Handling data imbalance using SMOTE
    5. Feature Engineering
        - Feature Selection
        - Feature Scaling
    6. Model Building/Evaluation
